                Level 38 and higher, we’ve boosted the level-up bonus to be

                ‘Recharge’ is a unique and exciting feature that rewards players
                with split bonuses (Recharges) throughout the week based on
                their gaming activities. Players can set different intervals to
                claim these bonuses, providing them with an added incentive to
                keep playing. <br />
                <br />
                In basic terms, ‘Recharge’ means that players receive split
                bonuses (Recharges) throughout the week at different intervals
                set by the player themselves. This feature not only keeps
                players engaged but also adds an extra layer of excitement to
                the gaming experience. <br /><br />
                Eligibility for Recharge Activation To be eligible for Recharge
                Activation, players must meet the following criteria: <br />

                2. Have wagered a minimum of $1,000 in the past 7 days (24/7)
                <br />
                <br />
                Once a player meets these requirements, they can request
                Recharge Activation. Upon activation, their Recharge will be
                redeemable for the next 7 days.

                The ‘Weekly Cashback’ is an exclusive perk on our platform
                designed for VIP 22+ players. As the name suggests, this bonus
                is issued once a week. It is an automatic bonus paid out every
                Friday to players at VIP level 22 and above. The size of the
                bonus depends on how much a player has wagered during the past
                week with a minimum wager requirement of $1000 between the
                period Friday-Thursday. The calculation for the weekly cashback
                remains the same, and the only difference is that it may not
                align with your Recharge renewals.
